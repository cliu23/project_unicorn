This story is Chapter One in my story about the fabulous GitHub. GitHub was a collaborative product between Sean Moo, Francisco Dog, and Project Unicorn. The first step of Project Unicorn is, please do not talk about Project Unicorn, even to your own family and grandma. Project Unicorn was created at the same time as Facebook and this is the reason that our logo is going to be blue. Our logo has not even been created yet but Mark Zuckerbarg called me and told me that he is going to help me with this computer programming stuff and then probably our logo will be a unicorn or a horse or a donkey. Everyone likes White Unicorns but I think that is racist so our unicorn will probably be yellow and black with a rainbow tail. Come to think of it, that reminds me of a bee. I like bees.
